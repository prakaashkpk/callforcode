Even though one of the main functions of a dam is their regulation mission to prevent floods and act as water reserves during the dry season. Most of the times Dams play a major role in causing the flooding. The most recent mis-managed late opening of Idukki dam along with all dams on its spillway caused a havoc in Kerela, contributing to flooding across more than half of kerala's districts and a huge human and recourse loss.

We propose an end to end solution for the complete management of dams through a Dashboard. The dashboard will have a view of all the dams with colour codings as following.

Red - In danger zone, needs constant look-out and water management and days left for the dam to fill. Detailed view will have the possible management suggestions for evacuation and water release.
Yellow - The dams receiving rainfall with detailed view on weather information and days left to turn red.
Green - The dam is in safe zone. No rainfall or lesser rainfall with detailed view on weather data and days left to turn yellow.

Dams requiring attention will have the following management information.
1. Possible flood marked areas over the map if the shutters are opened. The area will dynamically spread or shrink based on the value of shutter width.
2. Safe zone marked areas where the flood is unlikely to hit. 
3. Group chat windows and call routing provision for coordinating rescue operations across the team.
4. Push notifications for people who stay near by based on the current status and decision makings.
5. safe shutter valve width prediction based on the rainfall at flood marked areas.

Apart from the dashboard, we propose a mobile app for the people having the following capabilities.
1. Location based helpline numbers for the people contact.
2. A chat/community window for location sharing and other requirements related to rescue and life saving requirements.
3. A map based navigation capability for navigating any individual to the next safe zone.
